/**
 * Created by talha.naqvi on 05/04/17. You can create a new instance or inherit
 * and override default methods You may need access to data provider here, it
 * might make sense to pass a function which lets you fetch the latest data
 * provider Why only indexes? The answer is to allow data virtualization in the
 * future. Since layouts are accessed much before the actual render assuming
 * having all data upfront will only limit possibilites in the future.
 *
 * By design LayoutProvider forces you to think in terms of view types. What
 * that means is that you'll always be dealing with a finite set of view
 * templates with deterministic dimensions. We want to eliminate unnecessary
 * re-layouts that happen when height, by mistake, is not taken into
 * consideration. This patters ensures that your scrolling is as smooth as it
 * gets. You can always increase the number of types to handle non deterministic
 * scenarios.
 *
 * NOTE: You can also implement features such as ListView/GridView switch by
 * simple changing your layout provider.
